function RSI = calc_RSI(data, N)
% CALC_RSI      Calculate RSI indicator given stock price vector
%   RSI = calc_RSI(data, N) calculates the Relative Strength Index (RSI)
%   for the stock price vector, data, over a period of N trading days.
%   Typically the vector 'data' is a list of sequential closing prices for
%   a stock.
%
%   RSI = calc_RSI(data) uses the default period of 14 trading days in
%   calculating the RSI.
%
%   EXAMPLES
%       RSI = calc_RSI(stock,20);
%           Returns the RSI for the data in the vector 'stock' over a
%           period of 20 days.
%
%       RSI = calc_RSI(stock);
%           Returns the RSI for the data in the vector 'stock' using the
%           default period of 14.
%
%   DATA FORMAT
%       data - The vector 'data' must be a numerical vector containing
%           stock prices over consecutive days.  The first and oldest stock
%           price must be located in the first sample (data(1)), while the
%           last and newest stock price is at the end of the array
%           (data(end)).
%
%       N - N is a numerical number specifying the number of samples to use
%           for each period.  The default value is 14.
%
%       RSI - RSI is a vector returned by the program that contains the RSI
%           values calculated by the function.  The first RSI value is
%           calculated using the first N samples.  Therefore, the returned
%           RSI vector is not the same length as the data vector, but will
%           instead have length(data)-N samples.  The last sample in the
%           RSI vector (RSI(end)) corresponds to the RSI value for the most
%           recent date.
